## Project Overview
THe chief data scientist has given you several tasks to manage the standardized testing data of several schools. Which ultimately helps the school administration allocate budgets to the different schools.

1. A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
2. An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
3. Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  a. Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  b. The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  c. The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  d. School performance based on the budget per student
  e. School performance based on the school size 
  f. School performance based on the type of school
